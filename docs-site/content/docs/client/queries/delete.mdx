description: Delete one or more rows matching a condition.
---

`delete` removes rows matching the `where` condition and returns the deleted records.

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@superapp/db'
import type { SuperAppSchema } from '../generated/schema'

const db = createClient<SuperAppSchema>({ url, userToken })

const deleted = await db.main.orders.delete({
  where: { id: { $eq: 'ord_abc123' } },
})
// deleted: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; ... }[]
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `where` | `object` | Yes | Filter conditions for rows to delete |

## Single Row Delete

```typescript
const deleted = await db.main.orders.delete({
  where: { id: { $eq: 'ord_abc123' } },
})
// deleted: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; ... }[]
```

## Filtered Delete

Delete multiple rows matching a condition.

```typescript
const deleted = await db.main.orders.delete({
  where: { status: { $eq: 'cancelled' } },
})
// deleted: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; ... }[]
// All cancelled orders are removed
```

## Delete with Complex Filters

```typescript
const deleted = await db.main.orders.delete({
  where: {
    status: { $eq: 'expired' },
    created_at: { $lt: '2023-01-01' },
  },
})
// deleted: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; ... }[]
```

## Delete a Customer

```typescript
const deleted = await db.main.customers.delete({
  where: { id: { $eq: 'cust_abc123' } },
})
// deleted: { id: string; name: string; email: string; ... }[]
```
