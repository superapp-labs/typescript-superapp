description: Type-safe query builder and auth UI components for your frontend with zero server dependencies.
---

`@superapp/db` connects your frontend to any database through the superapp backend — with full type safety, authentication, and pre-built UI components.

## How It Works

Your client builds structured JSON queries and POSTs them to the `/data` endpoint with a JWT. The server validates the token, applies row-level permissions, and executes the query against your database.

```
Frontend (db.main.orders.findMany(...))
    ↓  structured JSON + JWT
POST /data
    ↓  permissions applied
Database → response
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@superapp/db'
import type { SuperAppSchema } from '../generated/schema'

const db = createClient<SuperAppSchema>({
  url: 'http://localhost:3001/data',
  userToken: 'eyJhbG...',
})

const orders = await db.main.orders.findMany({
  select: ['id', 'amount', 'status'],
  where: { status: { $eq: 'active' } },
  limit: 10,
})
// orders: { id: string; amount: number; status: string }[]
```

## Query Pattern

Every query follows the same pattern:

```
db.{connection}.{table}.{method}(options)
```

- **connection** — The database connection name defined in your server config (e.g., `main`).
- **table** — The table name in that database (e.g., `orders`, `customers`).
- **method** — The query method to execute.

## Available Methods
