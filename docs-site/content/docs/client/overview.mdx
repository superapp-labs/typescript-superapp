`@superapp/db` gives your frontend **real Drizzle ORM** connected to any database through the superapp backend. Same API you already know — permissions enforced automatically.

## How It Works

The client uses a Drizzle HTTP driver plugin that sends queries to the superapp backend. The server validates your JWT, applies row-level permissions, and executes against your database.

```text
Client (Drizzle ORM) --> HTTP Driver --> superapp Backend --> Permission Engine --> Database
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { drizzle } from '@superapp/db'
import { eq, desc } from 'drizzle-orm'
import * as schema from './generated/schema'

const db = drizzle({
  connection: 'http://localhost:3001',
  token: session.token,
  schema,
})

// Standard Drizzle queries — permissions enforced transparently
const orders = await db.select()
  .from(schema.orders)
  .where(eq(schema.orders.status, 'active'))
  .orderBy(desc(schema.orders.createdAt))
  .limit(10)
// orders: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; createdAt: Date }[]
```
