description: Drizzle ORM for the frontend — real Drizzle with an HTTP driver that returns permission-filtered data.
---

`@superapp/db` gives your frontend **real Drizzle ORM** connected to any database through the superapp backend. Same API you already know — the data you get back is already filtered, restricted, and validated by the backend's permission engine.

## How It Works

The client uses a Drizzle HTTP driver plugin that sends queries to the superapp backend. The server validates your JWT, applies row-level permissions, and executes against your database. The data returned to the client has already been filtered and restricted by the permission engine — the client consumes Drizzle ORM, but with all data scoped to the user's configured permissions.

```text
Client (Drizzle ORM) --> HTTP Driver --> superapp Backend --> Permission Engine --> Database
                                                                    │
                                                          Filters, restricts,
                                                          validates data
                                                                    │
                                                                    ▼
                                                          Returns scoped results
```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { drizzle } from '@superapp/db'
import { eq, desc } from 'drizzle-orm'
import * as schema from './generated/schema'

const db = drizzle({
  connection: 'http://localhost:3001',
  token: session.token,
  schema,
})

// Standard Drizzle queries — data returned is already filtered by permissions
const orders = await db.select()
  .from(schema.orders)
  .where(eq(schema.orders.status, 'active'))
  .orderBy(desc(schema.orders.createdAt))
  .limit(10)
// orders: { id: string; amount: number; status: string; createdAt: Date }[]
```
