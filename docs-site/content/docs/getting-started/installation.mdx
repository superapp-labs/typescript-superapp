title: Installation
description: Install the server engine and client SDK.
---

Two packages, two `npm install` commands, and you're ready.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (LTS recommended)
- **A database** — Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, or a directory of CSV files

## Install the Server Engine

In your backend project:

```bash
npm install @superapp/backend
```

This gives you the query engine, permission system, auth integration, admin UI, and all database adapters.

## Install the Client SDK

In your frontend project:

```bash
npm install @superapp/db
```

This gives you the type-safe query builder, auth client, and pre-built auth UI components. Zero server dependencies.

<Callout>
If your frontend and backend are in the same monorepo, install both. If they live in separate repos, install each in their respective project.
</Callout>

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your backend project with at minimum:

```bash
# Required
AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret-min-32-chars
SUPERAPP_MASTER_KEY=your-256-bit-master-key-hex

# At least one database connection
PG_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
```

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | Signs and verifies JWT tokens. Must be at least 32 characters. |
| `SUPERAPP_MASTER_KEY` | Encrypts connection URLs at rest (AES-256-GCM). |
| `PG_URL` | Postgres connection string. Replace with `MYSQL_URL` or a SQLite path depending on your database. |

<Callout type="warn">
Never commit `.env` files to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore`.
</Callout>
