`@superapp/backend` is a data access layer that turns your databases into a secure, authenticated API. Point it at Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, or CSV files and get instant CRUD with row-level security, audit logging, and an admin UI.

```typescript
import { createEngine } from '@superapp/backend'
import { createHonoMiddleware } from '@superapp/backend/adapters/hono'
import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
import { Hono } from 'hono'

const engine = createEngine({
  connections: {
    main: { type: 'postgres', url: process.env.PG_URL! },
  },
})

const app = new Hono()
app.route('/', createHonoMiddleware(engine))
serve({ fetch: app.fetch, port: 3001 })
```

## Execution Modes

The engine supports two query execution modes:

- **DuckDB mode** (default) -- Routes queries through DuckDB. Supports cross-database joins and CSV querying. Requires a Node.js-compatible runtime.
- **Direct mode** -- Sends queries directly to native database drivers (`pg`, `mysql2`, `better-sqlite3`). No DuckDB dependency. Deployable to edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers and Vercel Edge Functions.

```typescript
// Direct mode — edge-compatible
const engine = createEngine({
  executor: 'direct',
  connections: {
    main: { type: 'postgres', url: process.env.PG_URL! },
  },
})
```

Both modes share the same auth, permissions, middleware, and audit pipeline. See [Direct Connections](/docs/advanced/direct-connections) for details.

## Routes

| Route | Method | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/data` | `POST` | Query, insert, update, delete records |
| `/schema` | `GET` | Introspect available tables and columns |
| `/auth/*` | `*` | Authentication endpoints (login, register, session) |
| `/admin` | `GET` | Admin UI dashboard |
| `/admin/api/*` | `*` | Admin API for managing connections and permissions |

## Request Pipeline

Every `/data` request passes through a pipeline:

```text
Request → Rate Limit → Validate → JWT → Session → Roles → Permissions → Query Build → Execute → Audit → Response
```

The execution step uses DuckDB or native drivers depending on the `executor` setting. All other steps are identical.

## Key Concepts

- **Databases** -- Named database sources (Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, CSV) connected via providers
- **Executor** -- Query execution mode: `'duckdb'` (default) or `'direct'` (edge-compatible)
- **Auth Providers** -- Pluggable authentication (better-auth or custom); client-side auth lives in `@superapp/auth`
- **Permissions** -- Row-level security with filters, checks, and presets
- **Roles** -- Named groups of permissions assigned to users
- **Adapters** -- Framework bindings for Hono, Next.js, Express, and generic handlers
